We devise and implement novel data analysis solutions for biomedical research, particularly when proteomics data is involved.

The lab is responsible for the [Galaxy Integrated Omics (GIO)](http://gio.sbcs.qmul.ac.uk) web-based platform for integrated analysis of transcriptomic and proteomic data, and [PITDB](http://pitdb.org) - a database of translated genomic elements identified from proteomics informed by transcriptomics (PIT) experiments.
