#### About the Bessant Lab

We devise and implement novel data analysis solutions for biomedical research, particularly when proteomics data is involved. The lab is based in the [School of Biological and Chemical Sciences](http://www.sbcs.qmul.ac.uk/) at [Queen Mary](http://www.qmul.ac.uk/), [University of London](https://london.ac.uk/) and led by [Prof Conrad Bessant](http://www.sbcs.qmul.ac.uk/staff/conradbessant.html).

The lab is responsible for the [Galaxy Integrated Omics (GIO)](http://gio.sbcs.qmul.ac.uk) web-based platform for integrated analysis of transcriptomic and proteomic data, and [PITDB](http://pitdb.org) - a database of translated genomic elements identified from proteomics informed by transcriptomics (PIT) experiments. We also produced [Classyfire](https://cran.r-project.org/src/contrib/Archive/classyfire/), an R package for performing robustly validated machine learning experiments.

#### Join us

*As a postdoc:* We welcome enquiries from postdocs seeking to apply for [Marie Skłodowska-Curie Action Individual Fellowships](https://ec.europa.eu/research/mariecurieactions/actions/individual-fellowships_en). Please email Conrad Bessant [(c.bessant@qmul.ac.uk)](mailto:c.bessant@qmul.ac.uk) with your CV, inluding MSCA in the subject line.

*As a PhD student:* Funded PhD studentship opportunities are available occasionally, typically for candidates from the UK and EU member states. These will be advertised widely, e.g. on [findaphd.com](https://www.findaphd.com/phds/?Keywords=Bessant). We are also willing to consider applications from PhD students funded by scholarships, or other means of self-funding, from any country.

*An an MSc student:* Our [MSc Bioinformatics programme](https://qmul.ac.uk/msc-bioinfo) is one of the most popular in Europe. Apply now for late September start.
